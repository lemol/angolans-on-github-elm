{-| Represents available types of methods to use when merging a pull request.

  - Merge - Add all commits from the head branch to the base branch with a merge commit.
  - Rebase - Add all commits from the head branch onto the base branch individually.
  - Squash - Combine all commits from the head branch into a single commit in the base branch.

{-| Convert from a String representation to an elm representation enum.
This is the inverse of the Enum `toString` function. So you can call `toString` and then convert back `fromString` safely.

        |> Swapi.Enum.Episode.fromString

This can be useful for generating Strings to use for <select> menus to check which item was selected.
