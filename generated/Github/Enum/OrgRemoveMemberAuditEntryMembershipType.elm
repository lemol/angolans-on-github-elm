{-| The type of membership a user has with an Organization.

  - Admin - Organization administrators have full access and can change several settings,
    including the names of repositories that belong to the Organization and Owners
    team membership. In addition, organization admins can delete the organization
    and all of its repositories.
  - BillingManager - A billing manager is a user who manages the billing settings for the Organization, such as updating payment information.
  - DirectMember - A direct member is a user that is a member of the Organization.
  - OutsideCollaborator - An outside collaborator is a person who isn't explicitly a member of the
    Organization, but who has Read, Write, or Admin permissions to one or more
    repositories in the organization.
  - Unaffiliated - An unaffiliated collaborator is a person who is not a member of the
    Organization and does not have access to any repositories in the Organization.

{-| Convert from a String representation to an elm representation enum.
This is the inverse of the Enum `toString` function. So you can call `toString` and then convert back `fromString` safely.

This can be useful for generating Strings to use for <select> menus to check which item was selected.
